        <p><strong>Steps:</strong><br> 
<strong class="steps">Prepare the Steak:</strong>
Take the ribeye steaks out of the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30-45 minutes before cooking. This allows the steaks to cook more evenly.
Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.<br>
<strong class="steps">Seasoning:</strong>

Season both sides of each steak generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. You can also add any other preferred seasonings or steak rubs at this stage.<br>
<strong class="steps">Preheat the Pan or Grill:</strong>

Preheat a skillet, grill pan, or outdoor grill to high heat. You want the cooking surface to be very hot before adding the steaks.<br>
<strong class="steps">Cooking:</strong>

Drizzle a small amount of olive oil or vegetable oil onto both sides of the steaks, using your hands to rub it evenly.
Place the steaks onto the hot skillet, grill pan, or grill. Let them cook without moving them for about 3-4 minutes to develop a nice sear on one side.
After 3-4 minutes, flip the steaks using tongs and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time based on your preferred level of doneness: shorter for rare, longer for medium or well-done.
If desired, during the last minute of cooking, add a pat of butter, a few cloves of garlic, and some rosemary sprigs to the pan for extra flavor. Baste the steaks with the melted butter and aromatics.<br>
<strong class="steps">Resting:</strong>

Once the steaks are cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a cutting board or plate.
Allow the steaks to rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier steak when sliced.<br>
<strong class="steps">Serve:</strong>

After resting, slice the ribeye steaks against the grain into desired portions.
Serve the ribeye steak slices with your favorite side dishes, such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad.<br>
